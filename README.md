# web-ui-yakuana

Using Lauren Chandler's Design files, I have created a website close to what she envisioned. 

The home page at all stages (phone, tablet, desktop) replicates her design to the best of my ability. 
The about page is my creation, but was influenced by her design. 
The links to her original designs are below.

This site was built using a mobile-first design. 

## The Files - My contribution 

The index.html and about.html files have all of the content for their respective pages. Each section of the html has a comment above stating what it is and how it is referenced in the less files. Each section of the less also has comments to make the relationship between the pages explicit. 

The Home Page (Bookr) uses: 
* [index.html] 
    * [top-content.less]
    * [middle-content.less]
    * [bottom-content.less]
    * [footer.less]

The About Page (About) uses: 
* [about.html]
    * [about.less]
    * [footer.less]
    * Carousel (folder)
        * [Carousel.less]
        * [Carousel.js]

Both the Home Page and the About Page Use: 
* [global.less] 
    * [reset.less] 
    * [index.css] 
    * [index.less]
    * [variables.less]  
    * [mixins.less]

The links to the social media tags in the footer of each page are intentionally directed to #, so they will not lead the user to any specific social media platform.
